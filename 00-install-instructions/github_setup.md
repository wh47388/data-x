# Data-X: Github Setup Instructions
#### Author: Alexander Fred Ojala, Co-Instructor

**These instructions will guide you through the process of creating a private Github repository so that you can submit your homework solutions and collaborate with your classmates on your project.** 

1. Create a (free) Github account associated with your student `@berkeley.edu email` (if you do not have one already). You will need to have a verified `*.edu` email address for step 2. Choose a logical username, e.g.
  `alexanderfredojala`: [https://education.github.com/](https://education.github.com/)

2. When you have registered then request an educational discount. This is optional, but highly recommended (because a couple of private repos are free to host). Request a discount here: [https://education.github.com/](https://education.github.com/). You are a
  `Student` and you want an `Individual account`.

#### When you have a Github account that can create private repos, you need to complete the steps below:

1. Create a **private** repository on GitHub called `[YOUR_BERKELEY_ID]_data_x_s19`, where 

2. `[YOUR BERKELEY ID]` is your Berkeley email identifier -- e.g. in my case that would be *afo*. You will need to use this exact setup with dashes and underlines (no space, no capital letters, etc.). Select "Initialize this repository with a README" and choose "Python" in the pull- down menu to add a .gitignore file.

3. Add Ikhlaq (Github name: `ikhlaqsidhu` ), Alexander (GitHub name: `afo` ), Srikar (GitHub name: `srikarvaranasi123` ), and Tanya (Github name: `tpiplani`) as collaborators so we can push and pull to your private GitHub repo. To do this look at the upper right-hand corner of your repository's main page, you should see a button labelled "Settings". Click on "Settings". Choose the "Collaborators" button on the left-hand side of the "Settings" page.

4. In order to work locally with files in your repository you need to clone the repo to a directory on your computer (e.g., I use ~/src). You can do this in the terminal by running:

    `git clone https://github.com/[GIT USERNAME]/[BERKELEY ID]_data_x_s19`


#### PS. Don't worry if this is confusing in the beginning, you'll grasp it soon enough :)
